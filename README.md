#Active Record Lite

##Summary
ActiveRecordLite was built to explore how database changes occur using Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord, particularly how ActiveRecord translates associations and queries into SQL automatically. This project further demonstrates meta-programming knowledge. This project does not include every feature of ActiveRecord, but contains many popular methods such as the find, where, has_many, belongs_to, has_one_through, and has_many_through methods of ActiveRecord::Base.

ActiveRecordLite uses SQLite for its database engine.
