#Active Record Lite

##Summary
ActiveRecordLite was built to explore how database changes occur using Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord, particularly how ActiveRecord translates associations and queries into SQL automatically. This project further demonstrates meta-programming knowledge.

ActiveRecordLite contains hand-rolled versions of the find, where, has_many, belongs_to, has_one_through, and has_many_through methods of ActiveRecord::Base.
